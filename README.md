# Game Tool Generator

This is the beginnings of a small lib to generate different kinds of game tools. At the moment it generates only 3 different kinds of card decks; A Standard 52 card deck (with options to add Jokers), a UNO deck, and a Kille deck.

In the future this will also be able to generate different kind of die, and more card decks.
